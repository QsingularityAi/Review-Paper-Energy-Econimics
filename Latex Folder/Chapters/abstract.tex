Volatility in the oil market affects macroeconomic conditions.  Oil market modeling provides a framework for understanding oil market trend. In recent years, the world oil market is becoming more and more complex. And new methods are needed to perceive, simulate, and predict today's oil market. This review introduces several research and literature about the model of the oil market in world oil market, and divides these studies and methods into three categories: structural models, reduced form models, and artificial intelligence models. In structural model we focus on game-theoretical model, optimization model and simulation model. This classification is used to study the advantages of each method and limitations, to provide guidance for future researchers to select appropriate models for oil market modeling.
